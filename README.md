AS a coder
I want anaccurate README generator
SO THAT can create a README quickly for a new project

  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
  WHEN I am asked questions about my repository
  THEN a README.md is created with the name of my project and description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.
  WHEN I enter my project title, install, usage, contributers, and tests
  THEN it is rendered  appropriately in a new README
  WHEN I enter my GitHub username
  THEN it is rendered to the README Question section, with a link to my GitHub profile
  WHEN I enter my email
  THEN this is rendered to the README Question section, where you can ask further questions
